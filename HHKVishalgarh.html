				<h2>Vishalgad Fort in Kolhapur
				The Vishalgad fort, also known as "Khelna" or "Khilna" by the locals, was a significant Maratha fort. After annexing it in 1659, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj gave the place the name "Vishalgad," which translates as "great fort" in Marathi. The building, 76 kilometers northwest of Kolhapur and with a surface area of 1130 meters, was constructed on a hilltop in the Sahyadri mountain ranges at 3500 feet above sea level.</h2>
				<h2>The Vishalgad Fort, known initially as the Khilji Fort, was constructed in 1058 AD by the Shilahara ruler "Marsinh." Over the years, it came into the hands of numerous kings that ruled in and around the Deccan region. When Adilshah of Bijapur was in charge of the fort, Shivaji sought to take it over, but the fort's terrain made conquest seem impossible. Shivaji repeatedly stormed the fort, but the Adilshahi regiment resisted him heroically.

				Shivaji then came up with a plan. As a result, a group of Maratha troops went to the fort and persuaded the Adilshahi killedar (commander of the fort) that they had come to serve the Adilshahi because they were unhappy with Shivaji Maharaj's authority. After the Maratha's successful strategy, they staged a revolt the following day, resulting in complete chaos inside the fort. Shivaji Maharaj stormed the fort simultaneously from the outside and swiftly took control of it. The fort was, after that, christened "Vishalgad" by Shivaji.</h2>
				<h2>Vishalgad fort, is also called 'Khelna' or 'Khilna' by locals, and was one of the important forts of the Maratha empire. The name ‘Vishalgad’ means grand fort in Marathi, the name was given by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj after annexing it during 1659. The structure covers an area of 1130 m and was built on a hilltop in the Sahyadri mountain ranges at a height of 3500 feet above sea level, and is about 76 km north - west of Kolhapur.</h2>
				<h2>Best time to visit : All around the year.</h2>
				<h2>How to reach : State transport buses regularly ply from Kolhapur, Ratnagiri and Belgaum. Private cabs can be hired from Kolhapur.The nearest railway station is Kolhapur. Vishalgad fort is about 80 km from Kolhapur.</h2>
				<h2>Where to eat : There are food stalls and small eateries at the fort, but it is recommended to carry your own food and water.</h2>
				<h2>Where to stay : There is a Sanatorium on top of the fort, but ideally stay at a hotel in Kolhapur city which has numerous lodges and hotels.</h2>
