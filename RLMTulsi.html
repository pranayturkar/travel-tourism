				<h2>Tulsi Lake is a fresh water lake in northern Mumbai. It is stated to be the second largest lake in Mumbai and supplies part of the city's potable water.[1] This is one of the three lakes located in the Salsette Island; the other two being Powai Lake and Vihar Lake.[2] Both Tulsi lake and Vihar lake are located within the densely forested Sanjay Gandhi National Park or also known popularly as the Borivali National Park (BNP).</h2>
				<h2>Tulsi Lake is the second largest lake in the city of Mumbai, after Vihar Lake. This fresh water lake is located in northern Mumbai on the Salsette Island, along with the Vihar Lake, within the premises of Borivali National Park (also known as Sanjay Gandhi National Park). Tulsi Lake is refilled by collecting rainwater into a catchment area of about 676 hectares of Powai-Kanheri hill ranges. This lake was built by constructing a dam across River Tasso and redirecting the water. During monsoons, the water from Tulsi Lake flows out into the Powai Lake leading down into the Mithi River. The height of the hill in the catchment measures a maximum of 400m. The idea of formation of Tulsi Lake came as a back-up option for the Vihar Lake, to supplement the water requirements of the city of Mumbai. It is also noted for its flora and fauna. For more interesting information on Tulsi Lake, scroll further and find out.</h2>
