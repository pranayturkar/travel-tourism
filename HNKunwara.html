				<h2>Kunwara bhivsen is a small village in the Ramtek tahsil, 28.969 km. (18 miles) north of Nagpur on the bank of the river Pench.</h2>

				<h2>A hill by the village contains the remains of an old fort, its summit being encircled with walls made of ponderous masses of rock. The lines of defence over the pathway leading up the hillside are constructed with some skill and are attributed by the people to the Gavalis, There is a temple dedicated to Bhivsen. Nearby there is a well, which is 3.048 metres (10 ft.) deep and 3.048 metres (10 ft.) wide. Though the well is so shallow, surprisingly enough it does not dry up.</h2>
				<h2>As the name suggests, this is a place on the life-story of the great Bhima, the conqueror. It is titled as ‘Kunwara Bhimsen’. The reason why he was called ‘Kunwara’ or ‘unmarried’ is very interesting and mixed up with various local tales. Like most of the youth of today’s generation do, he too decided to not marry and remain a bachelor for a lifetime at the most ancient period of time. He wanted to live his life dedicated to the welfare of others. He wanted to help society to grow, enrich and develop. When he was just born and stepped into this wonderful world, many priests & saints have predicted that he was not the ordinary person and he will do some astonishing deeds in his life. Getting melted to his captivating & well-built personality, many women would die for him and appease in best possible ways. He rejected proposals of many princess and bachelor women who came to marry him. Keeping away with the desires to marry the great Bhimsen, and consenting with rejections, some ladies joined the philantropy started by Bhimsen.</h2>

				<h2>From the same spot, one can get a glimpse of beautiful crystal clear lake spreaded widely.  At the center of the lake, you could see an old deteriorating monument. It is considered as a palace which is slowly wiping out with the passage of time. You could luckily see the second or third floor, as other floors are at the depth of water. It is said that a princess used to live here who used to love the mighty one. She would support him in the work of upliftment of community. There is a rocky ponderous mountain at more than fifty feet of height above the water level. It is believed that the great Bhima would lift the heavy rocks and would make his place of abode. You will have an exhaustive trekking experience here. Once you reach the height, don’t forget to shout ‘Jai Bhim’ as it will make your esteem high. At the depth of the mountains, there is a den or gufa where the Bhimsen used to stay with his bloodthirsty lions.</h2>
