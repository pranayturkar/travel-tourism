				<h2>Located in the beautiful coastal village of Gorai in Mumbai, Essel World happens to be one of the largest amusement parks in India. For over two decades, this recreational hub has been the pioneer in rendering entertainment and leisure to its visitors from all over the globe.</h2>

				<h2>Owned by EsselWorld Leisure Private Ltd., the amusement center has been exquisitely built over sprawling acres of land and brings to you numerous exciting rides, different theme parks, dancing zones, gaming facilities, and several other entertaining activities.</h2>

				<h2>Alongside, lies the Water Kingdom which serves as an ideal summer destination. It attracts visitors from all over the country across different age groups and offers them a sheer pleasure. There are rides for all age groups and a visit to Essel World will certainly not be disappointing for you. The beautifully designed theme park with its impressive landscaped interiors is sure to leave you in absolute awe.</h2>

				<h2>The entire park adorns itself during festivals like Diwali, Holi, and New Year and gets marked by a lively, carnivalesque aura. The park sees a swarm of visitors on weekends as people often come here with their families for a dayâ€™s picnic.</h2>
				<h2>How To Reach Essel World</h2>
				<h2>From Mumbai Airport- The distance from Mumbai International Airport to Essel World is around 41 km and will take almost an hour if you are driving from the airport. You can easily hire a cab or opt for the bus services by the Bombay Electric Supply Transport to reach your destination. If you board a bus then the journey may take a little longer ( around 2 hours) and will drop you at the Pagoda bus stop, that lies nearby to the park.</h2>
				<h2>Best Time To Visit Essel World The ideal time to visit Essel World is during the cooler months lasting between October to March. During the winter months, especially during the Christmas and New Year, the park pulsates with life attracting hordes of visitors who come along to revel themselves with festive pomp.</h2>

				<h2>The visits get lowered during the summer and monsoon months due to sultry weather conditions and unpredictable downpours. Though, the city is famously known for its pleasant weather conditions throughout the year, if you happen to plan your schedule for a Mumbai visit, then winter will be the perfect time to explore around Essel World. Visit the Water Kingdom during the summer season and beat the heat with fun-filled moments.</h2>
