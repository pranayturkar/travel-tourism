				Maharaja Palace in Kolhapur History
				The building was finished in 1884. Hence, "Maharaja's New Palace" is the common name for this palace. Major Mant, a master architect, created this magnificent building. The palace is an amalgam of Hindu and Jain influences from Gujarat and Rajasthan, as well as Rajwada architecture.</h2>
