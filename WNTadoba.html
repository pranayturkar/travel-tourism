				<h2>Notably Maharashtra's oldest and largest National Park, the "Tadoba National Park", also known as the "Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve" is one of India's 47 project tiger reserves existing in India. It lies in the Chandrapur district of Maharashtra state and is approximately 150 km from Nagpur city. The total area of the tiger reserve is 1,727 Sq.km, which includes the Tadoba National Park, created in the year 1955. The Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary was formed in the year 1986 and was amalgamated with the park in 1995 to establish the present Tadoba Andheri Tiger Reserve. The word 'Tadoba' is derived from the name of God "Tadoba" or "Taru," which is praised by local tribal people of this region and "Andhari" is derived from the name of Andhari river that flows in this area.</h2>
				<h2>Major part of this forest lies in the hilly area, thus many hillocks and terrains provide shelter to the wild animals here.
				It has a dense forest area, smooth meadows, deep valleys, and a great atmosphere to stabilize more numbers of tigers.
				The main attraction of the Tadoba National Park is Jungle or Tiger Safari in an open top gypsy.</h2>
				<h2>This sprawling sanctuary hosts wide range of floral variety. Sixty percent of the woodland is covered by teak, along with other species including, Lendia,Tendu, Tiwas, Semal Mohuwa, Achar, Bhirra, Dhaoda and many more. The thick greenery boosts the beauty of the sanctuary.  Moreover, the proximity to famous Pench Tiger reserve makes it a famous destination. In addition to jungle safari, the sanctuary also hosts several events near Nagpur.The sanctuary can be covered by an exciting plan for a day tour near Nagpur</h2>
				<h2>Tadoba became one of Indiaâ€™s earliest national parks when it was so notified in 1955, the same year as Kanha. Yet its forests, grasslands and wildlife continued to suffer due to overexploitation, extensive cultivation, hunting and poaching. It was only in the 1970s that the four hunting blocks were finally closed for business, though illegal hunting continued. In 1986, 506.32 sq km of forest land adjoining the national park was notified as the Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary. The national park and the wildlife sanctuary were finally merged in 1993 when Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), spanning 622.87 sq km, was established.</h2>
				<h2>How to Reach</h2>
				<h2>Bus : Nearest Bus Station is Chandrapur Bus Station.</h2>

				<h2>Train : Nearest Railway Station is Chandrapur Railway Station.</h2>

				<h2>The park is open for visitors from 15th October to 30th June every season and remains full-day closed on every Tuesday.</h2>
