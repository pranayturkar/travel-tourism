				<h2>Khadakwasla Lake is a popular point of interest for locals as well as tourists visiting Pune. Since this lake is situated on the Khadakwasla Dam on Mutha River, it is named so. It is also referred to as Lake Fife sometimes as the construction of the dam and the lake was initiated by Captain Fife RE of the erstwhile British Army in 1869.</h2>

				<h2>Initially built to provide respite from drought in the pre-independence era, it currently is the main source of water for Pune and its suburbs. This lake is a popular choice for a day trip from Pune, and people come here to enjoy the views, wade into the waters or relish a picnic lunch while sitting under the canopy of a tree.</h2>

				<h2>Khadakwasla Dam is a dam on the Mutha River 21 km (13 mi) from the centre of the city of Pune in Maharashtra, India.[1][2] The dam created a reservoir known as Khadakwasla Lake which is the main source of water for Pune and its suburbs.</h2>

				<h2>In the vicinity of Khadakwasla Dam is the National Defence Academy (NDA), the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT), the College of Military Engineering, Pune (CME, Dapodi) and Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS). A few kilometres to the south lies Sinhagad Fort; the twin dams of Panshet and Varasgaon, which mainly supply water for irrigation but also feed into Khadakwasla Lake, lie just 8 km (5.0 mi) due west of the backwaters of Khadakwasla Lake.</h2>

				<h2>Khadakwasla Dam burst at 7:30 am on 12 July 1961, causing the greatest ever disaster to strike Pune. It was not blown up, as some have been led to believe, it simply collapsed at the point of greatest impulsive force, unable to withstand the destructive forces generated by three times the quantity of water gushing in from upstream than it was meant to store at peak capacity as placid water.</h2>

				<h2>Khadakwasla Dam visit timings are from 6 AM to 6 PM. It is open every day, so you can visit it anytime you prefer. You can go to Khadakwasla Dam at night too, but there won’t be much to enjoy during those hours.The entry is free.</h2>

				<h2>The best time to visit Khadakwasla Dam and Chowpatty is during monsoon (July – August). Winter months (November – February) are also good for a pleasant visit. During those days, the surrounding greenery is in its full bloom.</h2>

				<h2>The landscape looks pretty, especially during the evening hours. And you can spend a solitary evening, if you visit during the weekdays.You can spend about 1-2 hours at Khadakwasla Dam. But you'll also need about an hour more to visit Khadakwasla Dam from Pune, as it is on the outskirts. If you have time, pay a visit to Panshet Dam too. It offers many water activities.</h2>
