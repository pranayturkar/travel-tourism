The fort is said to have been built by Muhammad bin Tughluq who captured Nanded in 1318. In 1358, the fort was under the rule of Mohammed Shah I of the Bahmani Sultanate. In 1398 a local Gond chief from Berar captured Nanded and Mahur. In 1428 Ahmad Shah I Wali won the Nanded and Mahurgad. Burhan Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar defeated Aladdin Imad Shah of Berar Sultanate in 1527.
