				<h2>Warana River is a river that flows through the Warana river valley of Sangli and Kolhapur districts in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. It is an important tributary of the Krishna river.</h2>
				<h2>Geography and course: The river originates at a height of 914 m above sea level on Prachitgad near Patharpunj plateau in the Sahyadri mountain range. The river initially flows from northwest to southeast and then to the east. The river is about 1.5 km southwest of Sangli city, 584 m above sea level. Warana merges into Krishna river at Haripur near Sangli. The river Warana is 70 meters wide near the confluence and is prone to flooding. It has a course of total 158.029 kms.</h2>
