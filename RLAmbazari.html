				<h2>This lake is situated in the western border of Nagpur. The city of Nagpur is named after the river nag. This river originated from Aambazari lake. This lake has its origins in last century 1870 when it was ruled under Bhonsale dynasty. The main idea behind this lake was to supply water to the city. The name Ambazari was derived from the word Amba (a Marathi word for Mango). Surrounding the lake is a beautiful garden (maintained by Nagpur municipal corporation) covering an area of 18 acres with facilities like musical fountain, boat rides.</h2>
				
				<h2>Located on the southwest border of Nagpur in Maharashtra in India, the Ambazari Lake is one of the eleven lakes and largest one that the city of Nagpur houses. Boating facilities in rowboats, as well as self-driven paddleboats, are also available to the visitors, which add to the fun and excitement of visiting the lake and help them to explore the surrounding scenic beauty.</h2>

				<h2>The Ambazari Lake is situated just 6 kilometres away from the western outskirts of Nagpur and is looked after and maintained by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). It was initially built in the year 1870, under Bhonsle rule, for supplying water to the city. Just beside the Ambazari Lake, one can find the Ambazari Garden, which is particularly popular amongst the children and doubles up as an amusement park for them. The garden also has pavements walking, a fountain, electric rides and various amusement games for the kid. In fact, the lake derives its name Ambazari, because of this very fact that it is surrounded by mango trees. (The word Amba means mango in Marathi.) The Nag River also originates from here, and the site is indeed a marvel to look at!</h2>
