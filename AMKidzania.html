				<h2>KidZania Mumbai is an international chain of indoor centres devoted toward family entertainment. It is an innovating amusement park cum learning centre where children can perform the traditional duties of an adult like going to the bank or preparing food or enforcing law and order. </h2>

				<h2>The KidZania centre in Mumbai consists of a realistic replica of a real city- complete with buildings, shops, theatres and malls. It even houses child-sized versions of cars, traffic and pedestrians who move up and down the “streets” of the city replica.</h2>

				<h2>An exciting feature about the place is that the children who enrol there can earn currency known as “KidZo,” which they can deposit in the mock bank in KidZania Mumbai and use it for various activities like buying gifts on the premises. </h2>
				<h2>Activities for Toddlers: Toddlers can take part in happy deliveries like Dabbawala of KidZania and KidZania cash and value transport and even Quality Control and Inspection Hub. Activities such as “Serve the City” is conducted through police departments, emergency rooms, nurseries and a fire department, which allow the kids to see how the foundation of the city’s safety and care work from a young and formative age. In “Factory Inspection,” children can visit a mock Parle Biscuit factory and a Frooti Mango juice centre giving them an exciting insight into how these products are made.</h2>

				<h2>Activities for Adults: Adults are required to accompany their kids if they are under the age of 4. However, even if their kids are the centre of attention, the parents can engage in certain activities of their own. Adults can take part in role-playing activities alongside their kids and toddlers. Parents can also relax and spend quality time at the “Parent’s Lounge” where they can sit and relax while waiting for their children. The lounge is equipped with free Wi-Fi and a TV. </h2>
				<h2>How To Reach: The Chhatrapati Shivaji International Terminal is located in Santa Cruz. The distance between the airport and Kidzania Mumbai is in Ghatkopar Road is 9 km. There are several taxis for hire lined outside the airport that can take you to Kidzania Mumbai. Mumbai is also known for its well-connected and convenient auto service, and you will also find auto-rickshaws lined up outside the airport to help you reach your destination.</h2>
