				<h2>Vihar Lake (Pronunciation: [ʋiɦaːɾ]) is located near Vihar village on the Mithi River within the precincts of the Borivali National Park, also called the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, in North Mumbai. When built in 1860 (construction started in 1856), it was considered as the largest lake in Mumbai in the Salsette group of islands. It is hemmed between the Tulsi Lake and the Powai Lake (shown in map). It partly meets the drinking water needs of the Mumbai region. It supplies only 3% of the Mumbai city's water requirement, after filtration at Bhandup where the large water filtration plant is located.</h2>
				<h2>Vihar Lake hemmed between Powai Lake and Tulsi Lake, With the few thousand wells feeding the population of Mumbai tending to go dry during summer, the acute shortage of water resulted in protests by the local residents in June 1845. A two-man committee, appointed by the British rulers of the time, to examine the grievances of the agitators concurred with water shortage problem and stressed the urgent need to solve the water supply problem of Mumbai.</h2>
				<h2>IIT Bombay is located on the southern part of the lake.</h2>
				<h2>This region is also considered to be a constant film shooting location for Bollywood movies and many scenes of prominent movies have been shot with Vihar Lake in the background.  </h2>
				<h2>Being located in the center of the city, Vihar Lake can be accessed easily through Andheri-Santacruz stretch or via Goregoan.</h2>
 
				<h2>Mugger or Marsh Crocodile
				The lake and its catchment are protected by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and Sanjay Gandhi National Park Authority. The catchment areas of Vihar lake has high hills rising on all sides. The seclusion, protection, and security provided under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park has ensured well wooded hill slopes and abundant natural regeneration. Higher percentage of khair species has been noted in the catchment area of the lake.</h2>
				<h2>Vihar Lake is the largest lake in Mumbai. It is located within Sanjay Gandhi National Park near Vihar village on the Mithi River. The lake was built from 1856 to 1860 by the British government to overcome the drinking water woes of the people of southern Mumbai. It gets its water from The Powai-Kanheri hill ranges in the catchment area.</h2>
				<h2>Vihar Lake is just about 16 km from Vihar Lake and the fastest and most convenient way to cover the distance is by a cab/taxi. It takes close to an hour to travel from Mumbai Airport to Vihar Lake during the peak hours.</h2>
