				<h2>The lush greenery and scenery all around the popular Pashan Lake make it the perfect place to get away from the din of the city life of Pune. It is a man-made lake, built during the British era with the purpose of supplying water to the neighbourhood. Click here to know more about things to do in Pune.</h2>

				<h2>Presently, the charming natural set-up of the lake makes it an ideal spot for photography and landscape painting. Moreover, it is a paradise for birdwatchers as it is home to many resident and migratory birds such as cattle egret, coot, purple moorhen, white-breasted kingfisher and grey heron. Other fun activities that attract visitors to the lake are boating and fishing.</h2>

				<h2>Pashan Lake is an artificial lake near the suburb of Pashan, about 12 km from the city center of Pune, India. The lake was built in the British era to accommodate the water requirement of the neighbourhood. The main inlet of the lake is a small river (Ramnadi), which is even controlled by the barrage located to the north of the lake. The river originates from Bavdhan and flows via Pashan, Sutarwadi, Baner to Someshwarwadi before flowing into the main Mula river.[1] Pashan lake has a total catchment area of 40 square kilometres (15 sq mi), and serves as a source of water to the old Pashan village, and the Governor's residence, as well. Recent urbanisation around the lake has led to the fall in the quality of the water.</h2>
				<h2>Pashan Lake is open throughout the week. In the morning, it is open from 6 AM to 11 AM. For an evening visit, you can be there between 4 PM and 6 PM. No entry fee is required to visit Pashan Lake.</h2>

				<h2>The best time to visit Pashan Lake Pune is during winter, from November to February. The weather is pleasant throughout the day during those months. Also, you'll get to watch the migratory birds visiting the lake. It turns into a bird watching zone during the winters.</h2>

				<h2>How to reach Pashan Lake: Pashan Lake is about 12 km away from Pune railway station and about 18 km from the airport. And the following are the ways to reach the lake.</h2>

				<h2>By bus – Many city buses are available to the Pashan area. The Pashan Tank Rasta bus stop is the closest to the lake; only a 10-min walk away. You can also take an auto or taxi from there to the lake.</h2>

				<h2>By taxi/cab – It is best to book a private cab from top car rental companies in Pune to take you to Pashan Lake and other places around. With the usual traffic, it should take only about 30-45 minutes from the Pune city centre to the lake.</h2>
