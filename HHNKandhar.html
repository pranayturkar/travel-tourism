				<h2>Kandhar is a town and a municipal council in Nanded district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It lies near the western shore of Manyad Reservoir. Kandhar was famous as a major Jain centre in the Rashtrakuta kingdom, having Malkhed or Manyakheta as his capital. A huge statue of Kshetrapala (deity related to Jains) is found near the bhuikot; the statue is broken but from the toenail that survives, its height is estimated to be more than 50 feet. Presently, there is an old Digambar Jain Temple in Kandhar which is awaiting for its renovation. Kandhar is also famous for Kandhar Fort.</h2>
				<h2>History: 
				In 1649, Shah Jahan aimed to recapture Kandhar and sent Aurangzeb with 60,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry. The resultant Siege of Kandhar lasted for three months and 20 days.</h2>
				<h2>Kandhar Fort is a fort in Kandhar town in Nanded district of Maharashtra state of India. Encircling the fort, is a ditch filled with water. Its construction is attributed to the Rashtrakuta King Krishna III of Malkhed who styled himself as Kandharpuradhi Swar.
				Constructed at a strategic point on the banks of the River Manyad, it has its fortifications intact, thus making a visit worth the while.
				The beauty of the fort is that there are natural hillocks to its north, south and western sides with the river flowing from the east. Thus protected from all sides, it is spread over 24 acres of land and constructed on a plain top.
