				<h2>A popular hill station at an altitude of 2,047 ft above sea level, Lonavala is a romantic escape from the chaotic noise of city life. Salubrious climate, magnificent exquisiteness, historical forts, ancient caves and beautiful lakes make it the most sought after destination in India. The exquisiteness and charm of this place has always magnetized the attention of tourists, honeymooners, youth and celebrities.</h2>

				<h2>Lonavala and the adjacent Khandala are twin hill stations 622 metres (2,041 ft) above sea level, in the Sahyadri ranges that demarcate the Deccan Plateau and the Konkan coast. The hill stations sprawl over an approximate area of 38 square kilometres (15 sq mi). Tourism peaks during the monsoon season. The name Lonavala is derived from the words 'leni' which means caves and 'avali' which means series. i.e. 'a series of Caves' which is a reference to the many caves like Karla Caves, Bhaja Caves and Bedsa that are close to Lonavala. A trip to Lonavala and Khandala can be combined with sight-seeing visits of Karla, Bhaja and Bedsa caves and also the two fortresses, Lohagad and Visapur. Another place of interest is the Tungi fort, one of the forts captured by Malik Ahmad near the village of Karjat and was known for its natural strength.[4] The Andharban trek begins from village Pimpri, passes through dense forests, valleys and waterfalls and ends in Bhira.</h2>
