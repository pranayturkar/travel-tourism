				<h2>Shri Mahalakshmi Jagdamba Mandir Koradi
				Shri Mahalakshmi Jagdamba Mandir in Koradi, Nagpur is dedicated to Maa Jagdamba, a form of Mata Durga. This temple has the importance of a Shakti Peeth. In this temple is enshrined an idol of Jagdamba Mata, which is a Swayambhu idol (Self Appeared). Devotees here are blessed with the four components of a good life, namely – Artha, Dharma, Kaam and Mokhsa.</h2>
				<h2>Shree Mahalaxmi Jagdamba Mata Mandir (Koradi Temple, located on the banks of Koradi Lake, about 15kms north of Nagpur, Maharashtra is an old historical temple dedicated to Goddess Mahalaxmi. There are around 51 Shakti-peeths of Devi Jagadamba. The Temple of Devi of Koradi Shri Mahalaxmi Jagadamba is considered as one of the Shakti-peeths. The temple complex is crowded by huge mass during nine days long Navratri festival. On these festive days, at night more than 50,000 lamps were lighted at the temple premises.

				Earlier Koradi was known as Jakhapur, the ruler of Jakhapur, king Jholan, had seven sons, but he was unhappy because he longed for a daughter.  The king was unhappy as he had no daughter. He performed Yagya, Havan, Puja, Tapashchrya and pleased the Gods and requested them to bless him with a Daughter. A daughter with divine beauty was born. After seeing his daughter for the first time, the King felt that Adi Shakti manifested in the form of his daughter</h2>
				<h2>The king of Jholan had various experiences of the divine shakti who was born as his daughter. She had given him appropriate guidance which had made decision making easier for him. She had shown great visionary support in difficult times.

				Once in a war when she accompanied the king, she had shown great justice towards the king as well as his opponents. The king once again realised the power of that divine Shakti. While returning from the war, Jakhumai being the divine shakti decided to stop at the place where thesun would set. That place is regarded as Jakhapur (now Koradi). The moorti (idol) is believed to be ‘Swayambhu’ – manifested one, as nobody installed it.

				The surroundings consist of a Kund and Goumukh. There is a natural stream of cool water. Stones of Rangoli are still found in this area.

				The architectural beauty of the shrine finely showcases the ancient roots of the mandir. People are believed to succeed in the four components of a good life – Arth, Dharma, Kaam, Moksha with the blessings of Devi Jakhumai.</h2>
