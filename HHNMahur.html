				<h2>Mahurgad, also known as Mahur, is a city close to Nanded, which is quite prominent for its temples. Over here, one can find three mountains, each facilitated with a temple. The first one, and perhaps the most prominent one features the temple of Renuka Devi, who is the mother of the god Parshuram. Other two are called Datt Shikhar and Atri Anasuya Shikar. There are many other temples in Mahur like Jamdagni Temple, Parshuram Temple, Kalika temple, Devdeveshwar Temple, and also the Caves called Pandav Leni.

				A highly revered shrine for people of the Shaktism sect, Renuka Devi Temple is a must visit. According to historians, when Goddess Renuka was killed by her son, Parashurama; her head fell on the same place where the temple is currently located. Renuka was later given rebirth as a boon by Sage Jamadagni to his son Parashurama.</h2>
				<h2>History: 
				One can find the mention of Mahurgad in the ancient Devi Bhagavata Purana as "Matripura" or "Matapur," an important place for Shakti worshippers. The place is a significant for Muslims too as here can spot the famous Dargah of Baba SonaPir, who is also known as Mohar-e-Rasool (Stamp of Prophet). In every fifth of the month, a Urs has been conducted in Dargah. Many people come from different parts of the country to celebrate this occasion.</h2>
				<h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT
				Navratri, and Vijayadashami would be a good time to visit the temple. Specially on Vijayadashami when a special fest is organized here. On auspicious occasions like Navratri, and Datta Pournima, a special puja takes place at the temple.
				Mahur is the birthplace of Hindu God Dattatreya.[2] Dattatreya parents Atri Rishi and Sati Anasuya Mata lived here. Brahmadev, Vishnudev and Lord Shiva once got a news about Anusaya Mata that there is no one more pious and pure as her. To test her piousness they arrived under the garb of asking Alm (bhiksha). Near Mahur, There is a Pious confluence of River Penganga and River Pus at Hiwara Sangam village, Tal. Mahagaon Vidarbha, from where the river flows northward. Penganga river forms a border between Vidarbha and Marathwada. Mahur falls just about 3kms inside Marathwada due to river banks.</h2>
				<h2>GETTING THERE: 
				Mahur is mainly a town, which is three kilometers away from the Nanded. The only way to approach Mahur is by Road. There are frequent buses (State-run ST buses as well as private buses) from different cities of Maharashtra.</h2>
