				<h2>Powai Lake (Pronunciation: [pəʋəiː]) is an artificial lake, situated in Mumbai, in the Powai valley, where a Powai village with a cluster of huts existed. The city suburb called Powai shares its name with the lake. Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, one of the premier institutions of science and technology in India, is located to the east of the lake. Another famous institution, the National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), is also located close to the lake. Housing complexes and plush hotels are developed all around the lake periphery. Population around the lake has thus substantially increased over the years.</h2>
				<h2>Powai Lake is located downstream of the Vihar Lake on the Mithi River</h2>
				When it was built, the lake had an area of about 2.1 square kilometres (520 acres) and the depth varied from about 3 metres (9.8 ft) (at the periphery) to 12 metres (39 ft) at its deepest.</h2>
				<h2>The Powai lake attracts many migratory birds. Falcons, kingfishers and ducks are regular visitors at the lake. The place is thus popular among bird enthusiasts and photographers who love to capture those colourful creatures.</h2>
				<h2>Powai Lake has crocodiles and fishes too. But their sightings are a rare luxury.</h2>

				<h2>Local people love the Powai Lake as a place to spend some quality evening near the waters and at the nearby garden. Watching the sunset here would be another memorable experience in Mumbai for you, and that’s for sure.</h2>
				<h2>Best Time to visit Powai Lake</h2>
				<h2>The temperature in Mumbai remains high during summer. Therefore, the best time to visit this lake is in winter, from November to February. The temperature is favourable during the rainy season too. However, in case of heavy rains, the lake gets flooded. So, it’s best to avoid Powai Lake during rains.	</h2>
