				<h2>Maharashtra's Jyotiba Temple, a stunning temple, is located close to Ratnagiri, a village. The temple is constantly filled with "rang," which means "color," and refers to the hues utilized in Holi. This is because Lord Jyotiba receives the gulal as a sign of the pilgrims' sincerity. As implied by its name, the magnificent temple is dedicated to Lord Jyotiba, who was thought to be the embodiment of three separate deities.

Everyone feels at peace and at ease because of the building's quiet surroundings and divine nature.</h2>
